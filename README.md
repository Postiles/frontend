To run the code
======
Copy the "closure/goog" in Google Closure Library to "js/goog".


To update the dependency log of the code
======
First, copy the "closure/bin/build" directory in Google Closure Library to the project directory.

Then, simply run

`build/depswriter.py --root="js/postile" --output_file="js/postile/deps.js"`

at the project directory.
